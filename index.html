        <p class="normal-text">
          Remember HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)? The coding language that serves as the foundation for all web
          development? Well, if HTML is the first language you’ll want to learn when you’re interested in building
          websites, its cousin CSS is a close second.
        </p>

        <div class="text-block">
          <h2 class="block-title">What is CSS? And How Does It Relate to HMTL?</h2>
          <p class="block-text last-p">CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets with an emphasis placed on “Style.” While
            HTML is
            used to structure a web document (defining things like headlines and paragraphs, and allowing you to embed
            images, video, and other media), CSS comes through and specifies your document’s style—page layouts, colors,
            and fonts are all determined with CSS. Think of HTML as the foundation (every house has one), and CSS as the
            aesthetic choices (there’s a big difference between a Victorian mansion and a mid-century modern home).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="text-block">
          <h2 class="block-title">How Does CSS Work?</h2>
          <p class="block-text">CSS brings style to your web pages by interacting with HTML elements. Elements are the
            individual HTML components of a web page—for instance a paragraph—which in HTML might look like this:</p>
          <p class="block-code">p { color:pink; font-weight:bold; }</p>

          <p class="block-text">If you wanted to make this paragraph appear pink and bold to people viewing your web
            page
            through a web browser, you’d use CSS code that looks like this:</p>
          <p class="block-code">p { color:pink; font-weight:bold; }</p>

          <p class="block-text">In this case, “p” (the paragraph) is called the “selector”—it’s the part of CSS code
            specifying which HTML element the CSS styling will effect. In CSS, the selector is written to the left of
            the
            first curly bracket. The information between curly brackets is called a declaration, and it contains
            properties and values that are applied to the selector. Properties are things like font size, color, and
            margins, while values are the settings for those properties. In the example above, “color” and “font-weight”
            are both properties, and “pink” and “bold” are values. The full bracketed set of</p>
          <p class="block-code">{ color:pink; font-weight:bold; } </p>

          <p class="block-text">is the declaration, and again, “p” (meaning the HTML paragraph) is the selector. These
            same basic principles can be applied to change font sizes, background colors, margin indentations, and more.
            For instance. . .</p>
          <p class="block-code">body { background-color:lightblue; }</p>

          <p class="block-text">. . .would make your page’s background light blue, or. . .</p>
          <p class="block-code">p { font-size:20px; color:red; }</p>

          <p class="block-text last-p">. . .will create a 20 point font paragraph with red letters.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="text-block">
          <h2 class="block-title">External, Internal, or Inline CSS?</h2>
          <p class="block-text">You might be wondering how this CSS code is actually applied to HTML content, though.
            Much
            like HTML, CSS is written in simple, plain text through a text editor or word processor on your computer,
            and
            there are three main ways to add that CSS code to your HTML pages. CSS code (or Style Sheets) can be
            external,
            internal, or inline. External style sheets are saved as .css files and can be used to determine the
            appearance
            of an entire website through one file (rather than adding individual instances of CSS code to every HTML
            element you want to adjust). In order to use an external style sheet, your .html files need to include a
            header section that links to the external style sheet and looks something like this:</p>
          <p class="block-code">
            &lt;head&gt;<br>
            &lt;link rel=”stylesheet” type=”text/css” href=mysitestyle.css”&gt;<br>
            &lt;/head&gt;
          </p>


          <p class="block-text">This will link the .html file to your external style sheet (in this case,
            mysitestyle.css), and all of the CSS instructions in that file will then apply to your linked .html pages.
          </p>
          <p class="block-text">Internal style sheets are CSS instructions written directly into the header of a
            specific
            .html page. (This is especially useful if you have a single page on a site that has a unique look.) An
            internal style sheet looks something like this. . .</p>
          <p class="block-code">
            &lt;head&gt;<br>
            &lt;style&gt;<br>
            Body background-color:thistle; <br>
            P font-size:20px; color:mediumblue; <br>
            &lt;/style&gt;<br>
            &lt;/head&gt;
          </p>

          <p class="block-text">. . . a thistle background color and paragraphs with 20 point, medium blue font will now
            be applied to this single .html page.</p>
          <p class="block-text">Finally, inline styles are snippets of CSS written directly into HTML code, and
            applicable
            only to a single coding instance. For example:</p>
          <p class="block-code">&lt;h1 style=”font-size:40px;color:violet;”&gt;Check out this headline!&lt;/h1&gt;</p>

          <p class="block-text">would cause one specific headline on a single .html page to appear in violet, 40 point
            font.</p>
          <p class="block-text">Generally speaking, external style sheets are the most efficient method for implementing
            CSS on a website (it’s easier to keep track of and implement a site’s style from a dedicated CSS file),
            while
            internal style sheets and inline style can be used on a case by case basis when individual style changes
            need
            to be made.</p>
          <p class="block-text last-p">So if HTML is the foundation, frames, walls, and girders supporting your website,
            consider
            CSS the paint color, window styles, and landscaping that comes on afterward. You can’t get anywhere without
            putting that foundation up first, but—once you do—you’ll want to follow up with some style, and CSS is the
            ticket to unleashing your inner decorator.</p>
